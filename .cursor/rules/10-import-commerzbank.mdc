# Commerzbank Import

- Support CSV import as the "high accuracy" path; PDF import as fallback.
- Parsing pipeline:
  1) detect file type
  2) extract rows/text
  3) normalize fields (date, amount, currency, description)
  4) run categorization suggestions
  5) show Review Table
- Store per-transaction source pointers (row index / page+line) for debugging.
- Keep fixtures of real extracted text/CSV to prevent regressions.
