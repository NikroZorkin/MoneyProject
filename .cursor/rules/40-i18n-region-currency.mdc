# i18n / Region / Currency

- Implement locale-based routing and formatting with next-intl.
- Region affects: date format, number separators, week start, UI labels.
- Display currency:
  - reportCurrency chosen by user in Settings
  - amounts shown using Intl formatting based on locale + reportCurrency
- Do not tie "language" to "currency" automatically; user controls both.
