# Non-negotiables

- Never compute totals from LLM output. Totals come only from validated transaction records.
- Money is stored as integer cents. No floats.
- Every import must be auditable: keep source file metadata + extracted text/rows + parse result + user edits.
- UX must include Review Table before committing transactions.
- Prefer CSV import when available; PDF import is supported but considered more fragile.
